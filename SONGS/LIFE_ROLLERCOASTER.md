All my lifes been a roller coaster
when I turn around
i go and do it all over
never quite sure  I understand it
starting to think, thats how they planned it

step right up 
hands up and hands down
go swing a big hammer
when the circus is in town
take another swing, beat the high score,
just dont forget to hand your ticket to the man at the door 

(xxx) (sing it)
oh-ohhhh, ew-eww, ah-ahhh, ahhh

oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh, ahhh

oh-ohh, ew-eww, ah-ahhh yeah

oh-ohhh, ew-eww, ah-ahhh yeah
(XXX)come and stay for the show

all my life been a roller coaster
when i turn around
i go and do it all over
the man in the top hat, takes my money,
and im guessing how, thats why I never have any.

in a big tent under stadium lights
with the oversized shoes and ballerina tights
I'll perform for you 8 shows in a night
and inbetween, contemplate the meaning of life
(xxx) (sing it)

oh-ohhhh, ewww, ahhh, -ahhh
come and stay for the mystery
... oh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
all in for the trickery
oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
come and see the show
oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
(XXX)come and stay for the show(XXX)

 
all my lifes been a roller coaster
when the circus comes to town
I go and do it all over
come for the magic of a master magician
stay for the mind trick of superstition

here I am all in twisted glory
red nose and face paint
over toxic history
grandpa hid the bottle
by the fun house mirror
come again tomorrow
and ill make it all clearer


(xxx) (sing it)

oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
come and stay for the mystery
oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
all in for the trickery
oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
no escape from this misery
oh-ohhhh, ewww, ah-ahhh yeah
(XXX) come and stay for the show
(XXX)

if your up for an illusion
right this way to our institution
bubbles laundro mat white wash your mind
 ride a magic carpet, for a limited time

doctor clown on fire,  i need an operation
something tragically amiss, with his elegant equation
he tricked me once , and i cant believe it
go to small tent and
throw an elephant a penaut

(xxx) (sing it)
oh-oh --ew-eww - ahh - ah
come pay for the trickery - oh - ew - oh - ahh
then stay for the misery - oh - ew - ah - ahh
fat man into trickery  - oh - ew - oh - ahh
cotton candy of trickery  - oh - ew - oh - ahh

come and stay for the show

All my lifes been a roller coaster
take it for a whirl, then i do it all over
always thinking that im going somewhere
back to beginnin, and ending up nowhere

I was the falcon high above  it
flying free-eee-eee.
now a little leather strap
on a mans hand is securing me

Im a jungle tiger, climbing ever higher up a 
tree - eee - ee
cornered in a rage, put me in a cage
circus oddity.

All my lifes been a roller coaster
take it for a whirl, then i do it all over
always thinking that im going somewhere
back to beginnin, and ending up nowhere


Im a wild beast in a land of haste
and of mans gree- eed.
There coming for your horns,
a bullet to your skull
as an ornament 
for their hall.

Im the last man,
to raise up both my hands 
and plead for pe-ace
into the blooy eyes 
all mezmerized
to carnalize 
everything


Theres an animal at a carnival,
that we can not tame,
within a ma-aaa-an.
within our head

Theres an animal at a carnival,
that we can not tame,
within a ma-aaa-an.
within our head

All our lifes like a roller coaster
take it for a whirl, then we do it all over
always thinking that we are heading somewhere
back to beginning, and ending up nowhere

All our lifes like a roller coaster
take it for a spin, then start it all over
always thinking that we are going somewhere
back to beginning, and ending up nowhere

All our lifes been a roller coaster
take it for a whirl, then we do it all over
always thinking that we are heading somewhere
back to beginning, and ending up nowhere

yeah. whoa oh oh! Oh oh yeah ahh peace

look at that game
how to play 
they make us pay
and take us nowhere

oh-ohh. whoa oh oh! yeah - ahhh
take me to the liberty. 
whoa-ohh! yeah - ahhh
take me to the liberty. 
whoa-ohh! yeah - ahhh
they make us pay
and take us nowhere

oh-ohh. whoa oh oh! yeah - ahhh
free - eee- eee- eee  me!
