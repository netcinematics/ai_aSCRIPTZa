[CAPO: 3rd fret: E,G,D,A shapes]



I got pain in one eye
and it feels like im about to die
so I need one person to relate,

im 8 stories up,with no fire escape


in a jam, and my life is toast
so pop a campervan and hit the road
i dont care where the white line goes,
Ill follow it till it hits the coast.

yo-ho, 

hit the road
black and gold
off to to a land,
no one ever goes

i was rollin with no stopping
until she blocked that intersection
in desperation, she needed extraction
only one way outta that situation
one thumb up with braided hair
screaming some one gotta get me outta here

been so lonesome, that I cant stand it
some body help me, off this planet!


i dont care where the white line goes
just dont stop till it hits the coast
yo-ho,
jump in lets go.
lets go  lets go.
jump in lets go.
down a lonely road, where no body ever goes





black and gold stripes,
under the street lights
that city, back there's where I lost my mind
bogged down in a swamp of complication
so I handed that boss my resignation

set the GPS, and I'll meet you there,
whereever it is, you know, we wont care
we did not like, constant altercation
so we all headed in the opposite direction.

yo-ho 
lets go lets go
no matter where we go
we dont stop till we hit the coast.
yo-ho.
lets roll lets roll
black and gold off to to a land, no one ever goes


the tide rolls in, and the moon is full,
and I'm thinking that shes beautiful
her vibe is radient from head to toe
with a moonlight reflective of her soul 

i had one last chance, so I asked her to dance,
with love in the air, and sand in my hair
around a campfire, in the moonlight,
that beach was where I remade my life

go 
lets go lets go
no matter where it goes
we dont stop till it hits the coast.
yo-ho.
lets roll lets roll
black and gold off to to a land, no one ever goes


when its all adds up, 
at the end of the day,
which way was up,
and no body can say,
we might get tricked,
we might get played,
we just gotta escape,
while we still can get away

go

jump in, lets go,
down a lonely road
where no body ever goes

yo-ho 
lets roll lets roll 
I dont care where the white line goes
just dont stop till we hit the coast

yo-ho
jump in lets go
all in lets go
all aboard lets go

hit the road


<END>

hit hit the road

i dont really care where the white line goes

just dont stop till it hits the coast

yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho

hit the road




I asked her of her destination,

she said any way out of my situation

where you goin, i dont care

just take me far far away from here

to any place Ill feel no pain

go anywhere, just say the name

let's go.

Down a highway stripe, 

gold spots on a white line

all day all night

let's roll.





What did you expect to find.

someday someone will turn back time

someday somewhere far from here

youll choose the path,

into the mirror

go!

I wanna know

will you hit the road

black and gold spots on a white line

if you cross, you can never get back




to decipher fables we refine

fable-icious

fable-icious-ness






one day we might reunite.


and then one day I will hold your hand

dusty road ,

that long, long, road - that ive known.


I wanna dance but im not stoppin.

and everyone has fallen far behind

dusty road

break the cycle

bust that magnet

cut the line and

break the dragnet


coming home, dusty road, that ive known so long.






who are you

where did you go


where are you coming from

what did you know


what do you know

why have you been gone so long

im coming home, on a dusty road

been gone so long, that Ive forgotten

where i went wrong. dust road

Im coming home

crossroad of the heart and mind

and I dont know - where I went wrong.

traveliin on



I wanna run without stoppin

I wanna dance without droppin

I wanna get outside the walls



[2nd VERSE]

I saw her standing in the road (all alone)

with her bags packed and a tote

I asked her destination

she said anywhere out this situation

too many times my blue eyes cryin

too many times I feel like dyin

I said I know,


, hop in lets go.




I was so lonesome, I can stand it

help me to get off this planet


anyway you want to dammit

every last direction takes us home




far away from tragedy

all they wanna do is exploit me

take me to a place where no one goes


take me home

down a trail thats long been overgrown

on a long and winding lonesome road

lets go


take me home



Backing down from all we know,
I'm thinking that your beautiful
your vibe is radient from head to toe
with a mind reflective of your soul 

hop in lets go
off to a new home


while you played on a merry go round
i was forced to run from town to town
Ive done my time, shown myself around
Ive paid the piper and the clown 
thats how i know

attempt excapt to no avail
just take me far away from hell
ill go anyplace i dont care
just atke me far away from here
let's go

Hop in let's go

let us go-oh-ohh

down a trail long overgrown

on a long and winding highway road

let us roll

down the road

no matter whicch way we choose

the only way we lose is 

if we dont go

so let us go


if the ending is so near

then let us run far away from here

let it roll

like a cannon ball 
down a country road

let it roll

hop in lets go

down a trail long been overgrown

on a long and winding highway road

lets go



we pay no thought to where we land
or where to go, or what we planned
throw caution to the wind,
then reunite all over again
in the woods it was so splendid
how in the hell could it have ended

take me home

down a long and winding

lost deserted road

take me home



i was lost ou on a long long road

so many days that i dont know

until i saw her standing there

with one thumb up, and braided hair

where you goin, i dont care

just take me far away from here

to any place where Ill feel no pain

to anywhere just say the name

I'll go.


home

take me home

down a trail thats long been overgrown 

on a long and lonesome winding road

take me home
