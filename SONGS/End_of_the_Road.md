[HUMAN_INPUT:]

[I1]

I was lost out on the road

lost count of days so long ago


[I2]

I was laying in a field

as a breeze blew across my cheek

staring into the sunset

and the wind in a field of wheat


[P1]

(a) strung out from the cold (d,c, b)

(C) so I struck out on my own (d,c, b)

(G) went to see an old friend (d,c, b)

(a) asked him if this the end.

(G) the end of the road.

(C) end of the road.


(a) tell me of how it goes.

(C) to a place that no one knows.

(G) a place like paradise,

(a) nearby would be nice

(E) end of the road




as if there is no tomorrow

would there be no sorrow

and what would you say today

for time to pass away

(E) End of the road.



and if i had another chance

what would i say

Is this the end of the road

and of everything we know

or has the journey just begun

for everyone

Are we heading to a reunion

or we heading to our doom

if know one really knows

does it matter where it goes

(E) End of the road



[P2]

Is this the end of the road.

the end of all we know.

I reached out to a friend.

he tells me this is the end

the end of the show.

but i dont know.

As if anyone cared

I admit that i was scared

I was scarred from the bars

and the violence that i saw

in there eyes was a darkness

everywhere i went

that i couldnt run frum

And I was runnin scared

as if anyone would care


is this the end of the road

or the  end of all we know

if there was no tomorrow

what would you say today

friends and family 

that i banished 

would you take me in again

in again

would you finally apologies

for all the heartache and the lies

what would you say?

is this the end of the road

and everything that we know

day by day 

dust to dust 

mile by mile

i can see her smile.

pack your things so we can go 

to where no one knows

no one knows

rain falling all around

so much I saw you drown

that moment i went down

to pull you up again

up again.

my friend

Im sorry i let you 

I let you drown.

Is this the end of the road.

or a return to the unknown

city limit all alone.

all alone again.

I miss my friends.

I miss my friends.


The sun ember in the sky

as i go to meet some guy

hes got a job for me to do

i swear that i dont like it

but the money is good

so its what i do.


On the road, passing days

as the milestone tick away.

fogotten days, like a grave

like a grave.



voodoo heroes in disguise

got a stripper as an aliby

with demons as our friends

as the cop lights closin in

they clapped us into irons

just for living out our lives.


Is this the end of the road.

Or a reflection of all we know.

a dirty hotel again

the television sin

in the rain

wash all the pain

down the drain.

down the drain.

Dad, I thought Id follow my dream

why didnt you ever come visit me

broken ties, so it seems

all a wreck to me.

bad destiny.

Is this the end of the road

and all the peril that we know

everyone stares 

no one cares

is anyone there?


I traded all my friends

for a house with a wire fence

wired plans tired hands

tired heads


have we lost all we know

to the chaos of the hollows

will we let it all be lost 

and all forgotten

will be turn back our eyes

to the lives that we once prized

young and strong in paradise

and full of life

will we look throught lies

as we look that pest in the eyes

finally see past the disguise

and hearts we had left far behind

for a higher truth.

remain demoralized

as my brother is paralized

i blame father for his crimes

rest assured seeking retubution

or redemption.

for all the thought and all the miscalculations

we tried for genrations.

to start a revolution 

and an end to all confusion.

will we sit idly by 

because other had their try

and it didnt turn out quite right.

All was lost, waste of time, all hope was gone.


I seen the fire in their eyes

as they finally realized

its not best, as time is past, you cant get it back.

Many years ago.

before my father sold his soul.

We looked for a solution

to to clarify confusion

but got lost in the illuzion



But nobody wants to try.

and maybe you know why.

well i do too.

liberty died in the night

there wasnt even a fight

she sick for so long

we had all forgotten

have we forgotten.

The night that liberty dies is 

when no one sees eye to eye

all the minds are paryalized

about what is true, 

and what is truth, 

and what to do?


a prysm filled with lies
and everyone demonized
every view is in dispute
endless dispute


as a trickster demonizes every view

Was it caused by our reflection 

or by all of this rejection.

WHat is true, what is truth, what to do?


Look into my eyes.
and remember our younger days
the facts we found
the pact we made
common ground


every daughter and their mom
waiting by the phone
for word from the front
when will they come home


Stand up to the insane
and ask them to state the lies again
and again until they blend
into truth.

Look me in the eyes
and remember who paid the price
and why.

Recognize the slight of hand,
and the chill across the land,
our devotions been eroded
by a magic man.

Recognize the clever mind,
with a veil that keeps us blind.
with a rhyme biding time
diffuse our mind.

firewords in the sky,
The night that lady liberty died,
did you know, no one notices,
she was left behind.


She was sick for oh so long, 
while we were arguing about the bombs.
She passed and no one noticed
what was gone.

unspoken
unnoticed
unknown

Will you tell me once again
what it was like back then

As I insist, we were forced, into this.

Sing a song, write a story.
then maybe one day
they will say that someone found a way
to get past all this confusion, 
back to the truth.

and many years from now
when the children hear of how
we spent all our lives, 
living divided, undivided
and confused

And with passion in the heart
they look up to see the stars
the very same ones the same ones
that were there the whole way through








So many nights out on the road,

lose count of all the people I know,

so many times go to the show

your surrounded, but all alone.

in your soul.

buried deep down in your soul. yeah, yeah.





a friend who is in disguise

tolerate their lies

as they turn back the times

find a higher truth


Will we be demoralized,

Will you let them paralyize your mind

or will you fight throudh

# Variation 1 - Introspective Journey

[Verse 1]
The highway stretches endless now
Time slipped away somehow
Each mile marker fading fast
As present turns to past

[Verse 2]
Tall grass waves beneath the sky
As evening's light drifts by
Golden rays paint memories
In fields of dancing wheat

[Chorus]
Frozen in the winter's bite
I chose to walk alone at night
Seeking wisdom from an old friend's door
Asking if there's something more
Than just another road
Just another road

Tell me where the pathway leads
To mysteries nobody sees
To that garden in my mind
Where peace I hope to find
At the end of this road
The end of this road

# Variation 2 - Folk Narrative

[Verse 1]
Lost track of all my days
On this highway haze
No compass, no direction home
Just wheels and roads alone

[Verse 2]
Found myself in nature's arms
Far from city's charms
Watching daylight fade away
Through amber waves of grain

[Chorus]
When the cold cut through my bones
I knew I had to roam
To see that friend I used to know
Ask him where this path might go
Down this winding road
This winding road

Point me to that sacred space
That hidden, peaceful place
Like heaven here on earth
Just around the curve
Of this endless road
This endless road

# Variation 3 - Contemporary Alternative

[Verse 1]
Navigation's failing
Memory's derailing
Clock hands blur together now
Don't remember when or how

[Verse 2]
Grass against my skin
As the day grows dim
Sunset paints the evening sky
While golden wheat waves goodbye

[Chorus]
Shivering in December's hold
(Had to break away)
Found myself out in the cold
(Nothing left to say)
Knocked upon a familiar door
Asked if there was something more
Beyond this road
Beyond this road

Show me where the mystery flows
To places no one goes
Where paradise might wait
Before it gets too late
Past this road
Past this road

(3/5\3)
(a) what in hell she said, (c) its so good to see you, 
(a) all the roads are out (G) how did you ever get through
