# Little White Lies

I - I was alot like you were 

once upon a time

buried in lies

- 

Like a cushion on a stone

with a touch of sugar

the illusion alone

will only get us so far, oh

my best advice is 

to check reality twice

for fairy tales dipped in

little white lies



I - I was alot like you were

once upon a time, 

on an adrenaline line


a girl asks me

for a cup of sugar

to cook a cake

of something pure and good

but it laced with societies

sacharine vices

a powder keg, set

to muddy our minds.



a crystal palace

to run and hide, oh

daddys money is enough

to buy her a life,

but it cant help us

with the pain inside, no.

I - I was alot like you were 

once upon a time,

buried by lies



it might be nice

for a senator

to buy you a life

but it does nothin 

for the sulfur inside



a tank of gas

can only get us so far



Like a cushion on a stone

with a touch of sugar

the illusion alone

will only get us so far

it must be nice to say

that daddy will buy you a life

but it was nothin but 

a little white lie

[wind in beginning, ocean waves at the end]



a river bed

with no more water

to quench your thirst

down the highway of life, yeah

a desert land

with vulteres who sell paradise

never tell you about the

treacherous nights

I - I was alot like you were

once upon a time,

trapped in hologram mind,

it must be nice, to think

a vulture to buy you a life,

but its a desert that is buried in time


sold a powerful lie, yeah,


a princess on her throne

with a cup of sugar

cooks a candy palace

so shes safe inside, yeah

just recite a spell

manifest a fabulous life

forever after, trapped

by little white lies.


my best advice is 

to check reality twice

for fairy tales dipped in

little white lies


A dancer that I know

in a plastic prison

puts powder on her nose

just to hide her scar

she has a voice 

and a heart of gold that

adores you, but you coat it 

a masculine tar.


Oh I - I was a lot like you were

once upon a time

behind fairy tale eyes, yeah  

[(in fictional life)(subliminal lies)(trapped in a lie)]

Oh, oh o oh, I was a lot like you were once


a punk from houston,

prays for revolution

hed sick and tired 

of the corporate line of shit

he has a voice and a mohawk 

to fight off the

vampire bats

and their parasites.




Its social posion

force fed with a devious smile

choke on bile, it will quiet your mind

Im paranoid,

but not enough to notice you died,

suffocated from their litter inside you.


I - I was alot like you were 

once upon a time

a star on a stage to shine on 

but as you go they let you know

theres a knife at your back

at moments notice that the

crowd turns on you
