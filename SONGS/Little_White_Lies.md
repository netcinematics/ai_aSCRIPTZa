# Little White Lies

I - I was alot like you were 

once upon a time

buried in lies

- 

Like a cushion on a stone

with a touch of sugar

the illusion alone

will only get us so far, oh

my best advice is 

to check reality twice

for fairy tales dipped in

little white lies



I - I was alot like you were

once upon a time, 

on an adrenaline line


a girl asks me

for a cup of sugar

to cook a cake

of something pure and good

but it laced with societies

sacharine vices

a powder keg, set

to muddy our minds.



a crystal palace

to run and hide, oh

daddys money is enough

to buy her a life,

but it cant help us

with the pain inside, no.

I - I was alot like you were 

once upon a time,

buried by lies



it might be nice

for a senator

to buy you a life

but it does nothin 

for the sulfur inside



a tank of gas

can only get us so far



Like a cushion on a stone

with a touch of sugar

the illusion alone

will only get us so far

it must be nice to say

that daddy will buy you a life

but it was nothin but 

a little white lie

[wind in beginning, ocean waves at the end]



a river bed

with no more water

to quench your thirst

down the highway of life, yeah

a desert land

with vulteres who sell paradise

never tell you about the

treacherous nights

I - I was alot like you were

once upon a time,

trapped in hologram mind,

it must be nice, to think

a vulture to buy you a life,

but its a desert that is buried in time


sold a powerful lie, yeah,


a princess on her throne

with a cup of sugar

cooks a candy palace

so shes safe inside, yeah

just recite a spell

manifest a fabulous life

forever after, trapped

by little white lies.


my best advice is 

to check reality twice

for fairy tales dipped in

little white lies
